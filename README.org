* Introduction 

This is a git repo to manage the configuration files of emacs, so as to facilitate reversion to previously working configs and avoid conflicts. 

* How to use this repo

After pulling the latest version of the repo, copy the files initfile.org and init.el to your .emacs configuration.

New packages that you want to keep should go into the initfile.org list of package, instead of being installed via M-x package-install!
